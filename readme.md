# Multilingual Prime Counter

## Abstract
The goal of this project is to get a little insight into different programming languages.
Therefore a small challenge was defined to be implement in different programming languages.

## Challenge
The simple challenge is to count the prime numbers in a certain number range.

A console program takes the maximum number as an argument and prints how many prime numbers are up to this number.

## Comparison
A powershell script compares the runtime of the programs.

## Languages
